  mai_question: "What is MAI?"
  mai_description: "MAI is a CDP (collateralized debt position), a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by collateral, and available on %{chaincount} chains and across %{collateralcount} collaterals. Using the Mai Finance app, users can mint MAI by depositing an accepted collateral asset into a vault. When the loan is repaid to retrieve the collateral, the paid back MAI is burned. Mai Finance offers 0% interest on all loans with a 0.5% repayment fee. Visit the Mai Finance documentation for more details."
