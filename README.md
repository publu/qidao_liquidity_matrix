The liquidity matrix contains the information such as token name and symbol, available chains, onchain liquidity, trade slippage, wallet centralization information, 1M average daily volume, and relevant links such as links to a token's CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and native blockchain explorer. Additional, a risk grading is given based on a risk assessment performed on a linked rubric.

The QiDao rubric is based on Aave's risk assessment matrix and is a way to analyze the health of a token in order to add it as collateral, in QiDao's case, to mint the MAI stablecoin.

The rubric takes into account various onchain data such as token holders, number of transactions, and token age, as well as global liquidity information such as marketcap, trading volume, price volatility, and more.
