The liquidity matrix contains the information such as token name and symbol, available chains, on-chain liquidity, trade slippage, wallet centralization information, 1M average daily volume, total MAI debt, and relevant links such as links to a token's CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and native blockchain explorer. Data can be sorted directly from the site by table columns, or exported as an Excel-formatted spreadsheet.

Additionally, a collateral risk grading is given based on a risk assessment rubric detailed below.

The QiDao rubric is based on Aave's risk assessment matrix and is a way to analyze the health of a token in order to add it as collateral, in Qi Dao's case, to mint the MAI stablecoin.

The rubric takes into account various on-chain data such as token holders, number of transactions, and token age, as well as global liquidity information such as marketcap, trading volume, price volatility, and more.

Additionally, there is a dashboard to track various MAI metrics at a glance including MAI price tracking, various collateralization charts, MAI daily volume over 30 days, top collaterals by various categories, and more.
